# IN-12A Nixie Clock Project
## Overview
This PCB contains driver circuitry to handle high-voltage nixie tubes, which allows for binary-coded decimal to select the lit digit and independent PWM dimming for each tube. It also handles power conversion from a 12V 2A wall adapter to 170V, 5V, and 3.3V rails for the nixie tubes, development board, and ICs respectively, and accomodates connections to an ESP8266 WiFi module and an EK-TM4C1294XL development board from TI. These were chosen due to their relevance in my courses, and the design may be easily adapted to smaller microcontrollers more fitting for a clock.
